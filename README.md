# Repository Structure

**Note:** All folders mentioned here are relative to the root folder `protocol-specs`

The full specification can be found at `api/{module_name}/build/{module_name}.yaml`

This is an autogenerated file created by compiling multiple sets of components namely,

1. Enum: found at `api/{module_name}/components/enum/`
   * These are all the enums used in module specification while creating the module artifact
2. Examples: found at `api/{module_name}/components/examples/`
   * These are the examples created Illustrative use of the specification and embeeded in the yaml
   * Structure `api/{module_name}/components/examples/{api_name}/example_{#}.yaml`
3. Unresolved YAML: found at `api/{module_name}/components/beck_yaml.yaml`

The compilation flow is illustrated below

# Setup steps

## Pre-requisite

### Install swagger CLI

- Install the swagger command line tool using ``npm`` (Note: you may need to use root privileges if installing it globally)

```
sudo npm install -g swagger-cli
```

## Generate the resolved OpenAPI definition file on-demand

- Run the following command

```
./build_module {module_name}
```

- If the command runs successfully, you should see an output like this,

```
Created api/{module_name}/build/{module_name}.yaml from api/{module_name}/build/{module_name}.yaml
```
